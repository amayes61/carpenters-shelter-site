Their marriage soon ended and without the support of family, Omar was unable to keep his job and afford his home.\u00a0 One thing led to another and he ended up living on the streets for four years.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In March 2021, a homeless services provider from the City of Alexandria approached Omar while he was living near City Hall.\u00a0 She explained that he could live at Carpenter\u2019s Shelter and have a warm, safe place to sleep, plenty of food and necessities, and support from Carpenter\u2019s staff in finding a permanent place to live. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect but I decided to give it a try. I am really glad I did!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Carpenter\u2019s Case Management staff worked closely with Omar to help him achieve his goal of permanent housing.\u00a0 \u201cInitially, the thing I liked the most, after being homeless for so long, was having a mattress to sleep on.\u00a0 As time went on, I started to realize once I secured housing, I could go on to pursue my dream of earning my degree in Engineering. I\u2019m now very grateful for the stability and having my own place!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*Name changed for privacy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":6875,"template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"default","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"ast-content-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""}}},"class_list":["post-6874","our_stories","type-our_stories","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/carpentersshelter.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/our_stories\/6874"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/carpentersshelter.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/our_stories"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/carpentersshelter.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/our_stories"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/carpentersshelter.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/6875"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/carpentersshelter.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6874"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
