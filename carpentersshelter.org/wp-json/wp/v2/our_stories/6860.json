In addition to a goal of finding permanent housing, Sandy had a career goal of working with children. Sandy and our Education &amp; Employment Coordinator put together a plan of how to make this goal a reality. She was able to utilize Carpenter\u2019s Scholarship Fund to obtain her CDA (Child Development Associate) and she successfully found full-time employment so she could support her family while she earned her certification. Sandy worked hard at a local restaurant in the evenings which allowed her to complete her CDA classes and take care of her family during the day.<\/p>\n<p>Sandy and her children\u00a0moved out of the shelter and into\u00a0their own apartment\u00a0and she was able to maintain those expenses and\u00a0complete her CDA.
